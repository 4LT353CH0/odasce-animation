# Animation with GSAP #

    GSAP keeps the animation cross-browser-compatible. I couls have used CSS keyframes, but this might just be saving some time, but also learning the Greensock way of doing it. It's JS after all!

## Goals ##

* Ading to my personal skills
* Become more efficient for freelance work (SVG animation out of the bax)
* Pr√©paring skills for the REACT.JS framework (back to school, june - august)
* Finishing this shit for my client

### Utility links ###

* REACT.JS : https://reactjs.org/

#### Oh, almost forgot... ####

Don't hesitate to use this framework, but there's one condition :
