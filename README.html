<h1 id="animationwithgsap">Animation with GSAP</h1>

<pre><code>GSAP keeps the animation cross-browser-compatible. I could have used CSS keyframes, but this might just be saving some time, but also learning the Greensock way of doing it. It's JS after all!

<ul>
<li>Adding to my personal skills</li>
<li>Become more efficient for freelance work (SVG animation out of the bax)</li>
